# Crowd-Behaviour-Analysis

 üìå Overview
In high-density public areas, detecting abnormal crowd behaviour in real-time is critical for ensuring public safety and preventing incidents such as stampedes or riots.  
This project proposes an intelligent surveillance system that leverages **Finite Element Method (FEM)** combined with **video analysis and deep learning** to detect unusual crowd patterns.

 üéØ Problem Statement
Existing surveillance systems rely heavily on manual monitoring, which is:
- Time-consuming
- Prone to human error
- Inefficient for analyzing complex crowd interactions

There is a need for smarter, proactive surveillance that can understand and predict crowd behaviour.

üí° Proposed Solution
- Input: **Video frames**
- Pre-processing & FEM-based modeling of human movement
- Incorporation of **deep learning models** for anomaly detection
- Scoring system for abnormal pattern recognition
- Real-time alerts for early intervention

 ‚úÖ Advantages
- Real-time crowd analysis  
- Early detection of abnormal behaviour  
- Scalable and adaptable over time  

 ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations
- High computational cost  
- Sensitive to environmental variations  
- Scaling in very large environments can be challenging

 üìä Conclusion
This project combines **video surveillance** with the **Finite Element Method** to simulate human interactions and detect unusual or risky behaviours.  
Although computationally intensive, it has the potential to make public spaces much safer through
